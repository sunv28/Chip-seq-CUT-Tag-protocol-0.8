# 🔬 ChipSeq/CUT&Tag-upstream  
For Chip-seq/CUT&Tag-seq, I made a very **detailed** note 📓。  

<img src="./picture/086.png" width="1200"/>  





# 📚 Including :  

- ✅ interpretation of quality control reports  

- 📂 the detailed formats of various files (such as **bam**, **sam**, **bed** files)  

- 🧠 various theories  

- ⚙️ the usage of various parameters of various packages `(bowtie2`, `Deeptools`, `Bedtools`, `SAMtools`)  

- 🖥️ the environmental configuration, etc.

# 📉 Downstream analysis  

Downstream analysis : such as  
- 🔁 Genome Coordinate Conversion  
- 📊 Peak Overlap  
- 🧬 Peak Annotation  
- 🧩 Peak Comparison and Visualization  

you can see 👉 [sunv28/Analysis_of_peak_downstream: Analysis_of_peak_downstream are consist of three parts Genome Coordinate Conversion, Peak overlap ,peak Annotation, Comparison and Visualization](https://github.com/sunv28/Analysis_of_peak_downstream)
