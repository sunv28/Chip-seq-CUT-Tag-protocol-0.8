# Chip-seq-protocol
For Chip-seq/CUT&amp;Tag-seq, I made a very detailed note, which includes the interpretation of quality control reports, the detailed formats of various files (such as bam, sam, bed files), various principles, the usage of various parameters of various packages (bowtie2, Deeptools, Bedtools, SAMtools), and environmental configuration, etc.
