# Chip-seq-protocol
For Chip-seq/CUT&amp;Tag-seq, I made a very detailed note。

# Including :
interpretation of quality control reports
the detailed formats of various files (such as bam, sam, bed files)
various theories
the usage of various parameters of various packages (bowtie2, Deeptools, Bedtools, SAMtools)
the environmental configuration, etc.

# This note is not yet complete, only the first half，but there is enough content for reference
